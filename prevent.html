                <p class="fs-4 history-paragraph">
                    Scientists are still learning about COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus, but according
                    to the CDC, this highly contagious virus appears to be most commonly spread during close (within 6
                    feet) person-to-person contact through respiratory droplets.
                </p>
                <p class="fs-4 history-paragraph ">
                    The CDC also notes that COVID-19 can spread by airborne transmission, although this is less common
                    than close contact with a person. “Some infections can be spread by exposure to virus in small
                    droplets and particles that can linger in the air for minutes to hours,” the CDC states. “These
                    viruses may be able to infect people who are further than 6 feet away from the person who is
                    infected or after that person has left the space. These transmissions occurred within enclosed
                    spaces that had inadequate ventilation.”
                </p>
                <p class="fs-4 history-paragraph ">
                    Finally, it’s possible for coronavirus to spread through contaminated surfaces, but this is also
                    less likely. According to the CDC, “Based on data from lab studies on COVID-19 and what we know
                    about similar respiratory diseases, it may be possible that a person can get COVID-19 by touching a
                    surface or object that has the virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly
                    their eyes, but this isn’t thought to be the main way the virus spreads.”

                <p class="fs-4 history-paragraph">
                    Since close person-to-person contact appears to be the main source of transmission, social
                    distancing remains a key way to mitigate spread. The CDC recommends maintaining a distance of
                    approximately 6 feet from others in public places. This distance will help you avoid direct contact
                    with respiratory droplets produced by coughing or sneezing.
                </p>
                <p class="fs-4 history-paragraph ">
                    In addition, studies have found that outdoor settings with enough space to distance and good
                    ventilation will reduce risk of exposure. “There is up to 80% less transmission of the virus
                    happening outdoors versus indoors,” says Dr. Ashwin Vasan, an assistant attending physician in the
                    Department of Medicine at NewYork-Presbyterian/Columbia University Irving Medical Center and an
                    assistant professor at the Mailman School of Public Health and Columbia University Vagelos College
                    of Physicians and Surgeons. “One study found that of 318 outbreaks that accounted for 1,245
                    confirmed cases in China, only one outbreak occurred outdoors. That’s significant. I recommend
                    spending time with others outside. We’re not talking about going to a sporting event or a concert.
                    We’re talking about going for a walk or going to the park, or even having a conversation at a safe
                    distance with someone outside.”

                <h1 class="covid_heading mt-5">Wear a mask</h1>
                <p class="fs-4 history-paragraph">
                    Face masks have become essential accessories in protecting yourself and others from contracting
                    COVID-19. The CDC recommends that people wear face coverings in public settings, especially since
                    studies have shown that individuals with the novel coronavirus could be asymptomatic or
                    presymptomatic. (Face masks, however, do not replace social distancing recommendations.)
                    “Face masks are designed to provide a barrier between your airway and the outside world,” says Dr.
                    Ole Vielemeyer, medical director of Weill Cornell ID Associates and Travel Medicine in the Division
                    of Infectious Diseases at NewYork-Presbyterian/Weill Cornell Medical Center and Weill Cornell

                    the source of disease spread by trapping your own droplets in the mask, and also reduce the risk of
                    getting sick via droplets that contain the coronavirus by blocking access to your own airways.”

                    <p class="fs-4 history-paragraph">
                        Traveling can increase the spread of COVID-19 and put you at risk for contracting the disease. The CDC recommends avoiding non-essential travel to many international destinations during the pandemic. It also advises people to weigh the risks when it comes to domestic travel: “Travel increases your chance of getting and spreading COVID-19,” states the CDC. “Staying home is the best way to protect yourself and others from COVID-19.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="fs-4 history-paragraph ">
                        “For people at risk for the complications of COVID-19, such as those with underlying medical conditions or those who are older, it’s prudent to avoid travel,” says Dr. Goldberg.
                    </p>
                    <p class="fs-4 history-paragraph ">
                        If you must travel, take safety measures, consider your mode of transportation, and stay up to date on the restrictions that are in place at your destination. Adhering to your state’s quarantine rules after traveling will help prevent the spread of COVID-19.

                    The symptoms of infection for the coronavirus are often similar to those of other respiratory virus infections, such as influenza. Symptoms can include:

                    <li class="ms-5">Fever or chills</li>

                    <p class="fs-4 history-paragraph ">
                        With the COVID-19 pandemic now coinciding with flu season, it’s important to recognize the differences in symptoms — as well as get a flu shot. “The medical community is concerned that if we have an increased number of influenza cases, it will strain the hospital system on top of what’s already going on with the COVID-19 pandemic,” says Dr. Ting Ting Wong, an attending physician and infectious disease specialist at NewYork-Presbyterian Brooklyn Methodist Hospital.
                    </p>
                    <p class="fs-4 history-paragraph ">
                        If you think you may have been exposed to a person with COVID-19 and have symptoms, call ahead to a doctor’s office to see if you can get tested. You can also use a virtual care platform, such as NewYork-Presbyterian’s NYP OnDemand, to meet with a healthcare professional by videoconference. Avoid contact with others and wear a face mask if you need to leave your home when you are sick.
